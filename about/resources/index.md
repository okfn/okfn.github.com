# Labs Resources

Labs has various resources available for supporting its activities and those of
[Members and Contributors][members]. Some of these are reserved for [Contributors] but
may be requested by members. If you have any questions please [get in
touch][contact] (mailing list recommended).

[contact]: /contact/
[Contributors]: /about/#contributors
[members]: /members/


## Infrastructure

### Git repos

Labs Contirbutors may create Github git repos within the okfn organization and
deploy associated pages at http://okfnlabs.org/{repo}

### Storage

Labs operates long-term storage service using S3 at
<http://assets.okfnlabs.org/>

We also have significant amounts of less permanent storage associated to
specific servers.

At present access to this storage is generally reserved to [Contributors][] but
if you have material you would like us to host [let us know][contact].

### Servers and Hosting

#### Dedicated

We currently operate 2 large dedicated servers for use in hosting, processing
etc.

  * <http://hydrogen.okfnlabs.org/>
  * <http://helium.okfnlabs.org/>

By default these are only accessible for [Contributors][].

#### Heroku

We have a Heroku account. In general we tend to only use Heroku in its free
tier as it gets quite expensive.

#### AWS

AWS usage has been common among Labs members and it may be possible to access
AWS hosting services via Labs.

As these cost money this option is only accessible to [Contributors][].

### Jenkins

We operate a [Jenkins instance](http://jenkins.etl.openspending.org/) for
supervising and monitoring regular jobs.


## Communications

### Website and blog

Labs members can contribute to the website and blog. Contributions may need to
be reviewed by an [Official Labs Contributor][Contributors].

[Contributors][] have full access to the website and the associated blog.

### Messaging

Mailing lists, IRC etc. See the [contact page][contact].


## Coordination and Organizing

### Google Drive

We have public [Google Drive
Folder](https://drive.google.com/a/okfn.org/#folders/0B6R8dXc6Ji4JZ3FyVjJ1Z1QyMnM).

If you want write access please [mail us or contact us on irc][contact].
