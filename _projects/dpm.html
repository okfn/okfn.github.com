title: Data Package Manager
---

<p>
  <code>dpm</code> (data package manager) is a library and
  command-line tool for installing and
  managing <a href="http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/">data
  packages</a>.  Inspired by software package management tools
  like <code>apt</code> for Debian, <code>dpm</code> aims
  to <a href="http://data.okfn.org/vision">reduce the friction</a> of
  sharing and working with data.
