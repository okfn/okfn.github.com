Head Start is intended for scholars who want to get an overview of a research field. They could be young PhDs getting into a new field, or established scholars who venture into a neighboring field. The idea is that you can see the main areas and papers in a field at a glance without having to do weeks of searching and reading.

A prototypical implementation for the field of educational technology can be found on <a href="http://labs.mendeley.com/headstart" target="_blank">Mendeley Labs</a>. The visualization is also used in <a href="http://halley.exp.sis.pitt.edu/cn3/visualization.php?conferenceID=131" target="_blank">Conference Navigator 3</a> and in the <a href="http://organic-edunet.eu/en/#/recommended" target="_blank">Organic Edunet portal</a>.
