CrowdCrafting is a free, open-source crowd-sourcing and micro-tasking platform powered by the <a href="http://dev.pybossa.com">PyBossa</a> software. This platform enables people to <strong>create and run projects that utilize on-line assistance in performing tasks that require human cognition</strong> such as <em>image classification, transcription, geocoding and more</em>. CrowdCrafting is there to help researchers, civic hackers and developers to create projects where anyone around the world with some time, interest and an Internet connection can contribute.
