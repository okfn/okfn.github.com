The Open Knowledge Labs website (i.e. the site you're looking at right now) is itself a collaborative project of Open Knowledge.  It is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator, and hosted on GitHub Pages.  You can contribute by addressing some of the items on the project's GitHub [issue queue](https://github.com/okfn/okfn.github.com/issues) (hint: you can start with the [easy ones](https://github.com/okfn/okfn.github.com/labels/Easy)).
