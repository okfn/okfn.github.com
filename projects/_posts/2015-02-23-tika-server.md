This is a web service available for converting a multitude of document types to simple text. It is a public facing instance of the Apache Tika server (developer version). It lives at:

http://beta.offenedaten.de:9998/tika

To test it, just throw some images with text in them at it. For example, on a terminal on Mac or Linux:

    curl -T tiff_example.tif http://beta.offenedaten.de:9998/tika

More details at http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2015/02/21/documents-to-text.html. Please note that Matt is not the author of the software, just the developer for the Dockerfile that makes setting up an instance of what is quite a large piece of software very straightforward.
