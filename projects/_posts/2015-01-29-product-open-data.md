tagline: Building the world's largest public product database
---

The goal of this project is to build the largest open product database
in the world.  Such a database would allow consumers to get
information about a given product in real time by simply scanning its
barcode with their mobile phone.  It would also allow consumers to
publish their opinions about products in an easily accessible way.

We are currently rebooting this project and are looking for
contributors.  An
[Android client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.okfn.pod)
([source](https://github.com/okfn/product-browser-android)) is
available, and work has started on an
[iOS client](https://github.com/okfn/product-browser-ios).  If you'd
like to contribute or find out more, you can join the working group
[mailing list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/product), follow
the project on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/openproductdata), and
join the discussion on the
[Open Knowledge forum](http://discuss.okfn.org/category/open-knowledge-labs/open-product-data).
