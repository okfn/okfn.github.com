This is a small application developed using Ruby-on-Rails. You upload a
datapackage.json file to it along with the corresponding CSV files and it gives
you a read-only HTTP API. It's pretty simple - it uses the metadata in the
datapackage.json file to import each CSV file into its own database table. Once
imported, various API endpoints become available for metadata and data. You can
perform simple queries on the data, controlling the ordering, paging and
variable selection. It also talks to the DataTables jQuery plug-in.
