Nomenklatura de-duplicates and integrates different names for entities - people, organisations or public bodies - to help you clean up messy data and to find links between different datasets.

The service will create references for all entities mentioned in a source dataset. It then helps you to define which of these entities are duplicates and what the canonical name for a given entity should be. This information is available in data cleaning tools like OpenRefine or in custom data processing scripts, so that you can automatically apply existing mappings in the future.

The focus of nomenklatura is on data integration, it does not provide further functionality with regards to the people and organisations that it helps to keep track of.

<p>Nomenklatura is a simple service that makes it easy to maintain a canonical list of entities such as persons, companies or event streets and to match messy input, such as their names against that canonical list – for example, matching Acme Widgets, Acme Widgets Inc and Acme Widgets Incorporated to the canonical ""Acme Widgets"".</p>

<p>With Nomenklatura its a matters of minutes to set up your own set of master data to match against and it provides a simple user interface and API which you can then use do matching (the API is compatible with Open Refine's reconciliation function).</p>

<p>Nomenklatura can not only store the master set of entities you want to match against but also will learn and record the various aliases for a given entity - such as a person, organisation or place - may have in various datasets.</p>

There's too much friction working with data - friction getting data, friction
processing data, friction sharing data.

This friction stops people doing stuff: stops them creating, sharing,
collaborating, and using data - especially amongst more distributed
communities. It kills the cycles of find, improve, share that would make for a dynamic,
productive and attractive (open) data ecosystem.

We need to make an ecosystem that, like open-source for software, is useful and
attractive to those without any principled interest, the vast majority who
simply want the best tool for the job, the easiest route to their goal.

We think that by getting a few key pieces in place we can reduce friction
enough to revolutionize how the (open) data ecosystem operates with massively
improved data quality, utilization and sharing.

We're creating:

* Standards: A small set of lightweight 'data package' standards and patterns
  providing a base structure on which tooling and integration can build.
* Tooling and Integration: Making it easy to use and publish data packages from
  your existing apps and workflows whether that's Excel, R, or Hadoop!
* Outreach and Community: Engaging and evangelizing around the concepts,
  standards and tooling and building a community of users and contributors.

This is a web service available for converting a multitude of document types to simple text. It is a public facing instance of the Apache Tika server (developer version). It lives at:

http://beta.offenedaten.de:9998/tika

To test it, just throw some images with text in them at it. For example, on a terminal on Mac or Linux:

    curl -T tiff_example.tif http://beta.offenedaten.de:9998/tika

More details at http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2015/02/21/documents-to-text.html. Please note that Matt is not the author of the software, just the developer for the Dockerfile that makes setting up an instance of what is quite a large piece of software very straightforward.

The Good Tables web service provides an API and UI for processing and validating tabular data,
providing an http layer around the <a href=""https://github.com/okfn/goodtables"">Good Tables Python library</a>.

Currently, this means data can be provided in CSV or Excel format, and the file will
be validated for well-formedness (for example, no empty rows or columns, no duplicate
rows, all rows have valid dimensions, and so on), and conformance to a schema
(if a <a href=""http://dataprotocols.org/json-table-schema/"">JSON Table Schema</a> is supplied).

 `Puppycide Database Project` is the largest public compilation of records related to killings of animals by police in the United States. The failure of US law enforcement to make records of lethal force available to the public has become a widely documented issue over the last few years. Despite the publicity, the issue remains unresolved at all levels of government - state, municipal and federal - leaving a small number of private, non-profit organizations to provide such basic information as human fatalities to researchers and journalists. The `Puppycide Database Project` is one such organization.

 At present, the project relies on crowd-sourcing, and has developed several forms to record data and allow volunteers to encode existing database records for the purpose of Krippendorff's alpha calculation. New records get announced via social media. We also provide a [rapidly-growing library of legal documents & research](https://puppycidedb.com/datasets.html) related to police use of force issues - everything from lawsuit decisions to CDC emergency room admissions.

 All of the core functionality for our project relies on open source applications. Some examples:

 * Full text search capability using [Sphinx](https://github.com/sphinxsearch/sphinx)
 * Blog platform using [ghost/nodejs](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost)
 * Twitter connectivity using [Codebird](https://github.com/jublonet/codebird-php)

 Our biggest upcoming code project is the customization and implementation of a web crawler in order to accelerate the growth of our database. The crawler will seek and retrieve pages related to police use of force. In addition to adding more puppycide records, we will use the resulting information to study how news organizations report on issues of lethal force. This upcoming project could really use the input and advice of skilled developers and admins. Our biggest challenge is how to most effectively use the (very small) amount of resources available to us.

This is a small application developed using Ruby-on-Rails. You upload a
datapackage.json file to it along with the corresponding CSV files and it gives
you a read-only HTTP API. It's pretty simple - it uses the metadata in the
datapackage.json file to import each CSV file into its own database table. Once
imported, various API endpoints become available for metadata and data. You can
perform simple queries on the data, controlling the ordering, paging and
variable selection. It also talks to the DataTables jQuery plug-in.
