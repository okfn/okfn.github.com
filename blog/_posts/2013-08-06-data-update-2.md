[data.okfn.org][1] is the Labs' repository of high-quality, easy-to-use open data. This update summarizes some of the improvements to data.okfn.org that have taken place over the past two months.

## New tools

Several tools which make it easier to use the [Data Package standard][2] are now operational. These include a creator, a  viewer, and a validator for Data Packages.

### Data Package Creator

Turning a CSV into a Data Package means creating a file, `datapackage.json`, which houses the metadata associated with the CSV. The [Data Package Creator][3] simplifies this process. Provide the Creator with the URL of a CSV and it will return a well-formed JSON object with the required fields, as well as a raw JSON URL.

### Data Package Viewer

The metadata included with Data Packages makes it possible to construct insightful displays of their data without further ado. The [Data Package Viewer][4] is a simple proof of this concept. Given the URL of a Data Package metadata file, the DP Viewer generates a user-friendly description, a graph of the data, and a summary of the data's fields. Here, for example, is the Viewer's display of [US wheat production][5] data.

## New datasets

The biggest dataset news is a data.okfn.org first: a contribution of a dataset *out of the blue* by a new user. [Evan Wheeler][6] has contributed a comprehensive collection of [country codes][7] for the world's countries in Simple Data Format. Here is the [GitHub repo][8] for the dataset.

Also new: 

- [Standard and Poor's 500 Index Data][9], including Dividend, Earnings, and P/E Ratio ([GitHub][10])
- [US Consumer Price Index and Inflation][11], monthly time series from January 1913 ([GitHub][12]) 

If you want to contribute a new dataset, check out the [instructions][13] and the [outstanding requests][14].

## New standards pages

Among data.okfn.org's chief contributions are its [standards][15] for data transport, a step towards a world of [frictionless data][16].

New pages have been added for each of the two major standards, [Data Package][17] and [Simple Data Format][18].

## Get involved

Anyone can contribute, and it's easy â€“ if you can use a spreadsheet, you can help!

Instructions for getting involved can be found [here][19].
