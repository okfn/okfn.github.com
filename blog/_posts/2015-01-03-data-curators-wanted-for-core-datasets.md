Wanted: volunteers to join a team of "Data Curators" maintaining **"core" datasets** (like GDP or ISO-codes) in **high-quality, easy-to-use and open** form.

[frictionless]: http://data.okfn.org/
[dp]: http://data.okfn.org/doc/data-package/
[tdp]: http://data.okfn.org/doc/tabular-data-package/

* **What is the project about**: Collecting and maintaining important and commonly-used (“core”) datasets in high-quality, standardized and easy-to-use form - in particular, as up-to-date, well-structured [Data Packages][dp].  
  The "Core Datasets" effort is part of the broader [Frictionless Data initiative][frictionless].
* **What would you be doing**: identifying and locating core (public) datasets, cleaning and standardizing the data and making sure the results are kept up to date and easy to use
* **Who can participate**: anyone can contribute. Details on the skills needed are below.
* **Get involved**: read more below or jump straight to [the sign-up section](#sign-up).

## What is the Core Datasets effort?

Summary: Collect and maintain important and commonly-used (“core”) datasets in high-quality, reliable and easy-to-use form (as Data Packages).

Core = important and commonly-used datasets e.g. reference data (country codes) and indicators (inflation, GDP)

Curate = take existing data and provide it in high-quality, reliable, and easy-to-use form (standardized, structured, open)

* **Full details**: including slide-deck at <http://data.okfn.org/roadmap/core-datasets>.
* **Live examples**: You can find already packaged core datasets at <http://data.okfn.org/data/> and in "raw" form on Github at <https://github.com/datasets/>

## What Roles and Skills are Needed

We need a variety of roles from identifying new "core" datasets to packaging the data to performing quality control (checking metadata etc).

**Core Skills** - at least one of these skills will be needed:

* **Data Wrangling Experience**. Many of our source datasets are not complex (just an Excel file or similar) and can be "wrangled" in a Spreadsheet program. What we therefore recommend is at least one of:
  * Experience with a Spreadsheet application such as Excel or (preferably) Google Docs including use of formulas and (desirably) macros (you should at least know how you could quickly convert a cell containing '2014' to '2014-01-01' across 1000 rows)
  * Coding for data processing (especially scraping) in one or more of python, javascript, bash
* **Data sleuthing** - the ability to dig up data on the web (specific desirable skills: you know how to search by filetype in google, you know where the developer tools are in chrome or firefox, you know how to find the URL a form posts to)

**Desirable Skills** (the more the better!):

* Data vs Metadata: know difference between data and metadata
* Familiarity with Git (and Github)
* Familiarity with a command line (preferably bash)
* Know what JSON is
* Mac or Unix is your default operating system (will make access to relevant tools that much easier)
* Knowledge of Web APIs and/or HTML
* Use of curl or similar command line tool for accessing Web APIs or web pages
* Scraping using a command line tool or (even better) by coding yourself
* Know what a Data Package and a Tabular Data Package are
* Know what a text editor is (e.g. notepad, textmate, vim, emacs, ...) and know how to use it (useful for both working with data and for editing Data Package metadata)

## Get Involved - Sign Up Now!

We are looking for volunteer contributors to form a "curation team".

* **Time commitment**: Members of the team commit to at least 8-16h per month (though this will be an average - if you are especially busy with other things one month and do less that is fine)
* **Schedule**: There is no schedule so you can contribute at any time that is good for you - evenings, weekeneds, lunch-times etc
* **Location**: all activity will be carried out online so you can be based anywhere in the world
* **Skills**: see above

To register your interest fill in the following form. Any questions, please [get in touch directly](/contact/).

### Want to Dive Straight In?

Can't wait to get started as a Data Curator? You can dive straight in and start packaging the already-selected (but not packaged) core datasets. Full instructions here:
