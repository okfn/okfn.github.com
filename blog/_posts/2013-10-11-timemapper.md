TimeMapper lets you create elegant and embeddable timemaps quickly and easily from a simple spreadsheet.

A timemap is an interactive timeline whose items connect to a geomap. Creating a timemap with TimeMapper is as easy as filling in a spreadsheet template and copying its URL.

In this quick walkthrough, we'll learn how to recreate the [timemap of medieval philosophers](http://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/okfn/medieval-philosophers) shown above using TimeMapper.

## Getting started with TimeMapper

To get started, go to the [TimeMapper website][2] and sign in using your [Twitter][3] account. Then click **Create a new Timeline or TimeMap** to start a new project. As you'll see, it really is as easy as 1-2-3.

TimeMapper projects are generated from [Google Sheets](http://docs.google.com) spreadsheets. Each item on the timemap – an event, an individual, or anything else associated with a date (or two, for the start and end of a period) – is a spreadsheet row.

What can you put in the spreadsheet? Check out the [TimeMapper template][4]. It contains all of the columns that TimeMapper understands, plus a row of cells explaining what each of them means. Your timemap doesn't have to use all of these columns, though—it just requires a *Start* date, a *Title*, and a *Description* for each item, plus geographical coordinates for the map.

So you've put your data in a Google spreadsheet—how can you make it into a timemap? Easy! From Google Sheets, click on the **Share** button, and set the sheet's visibility to *Anyone who has the link can **view***. Then you can either copy the URL from *Link to share* and paste that URL into the box in Step 2 of the TimeMapper creation process or click on **Select from Your Google Drive** to just browse to the sheet. Whichever you do, then hit **Connect and Publish**—and voilà!

Embedding your new timemap is just as easy as creating it. Click on **Embed** in the top right corner. It will pop up a snippet of HTML which you can paste into your webpage to embed the timemap. And that's all it takes!

## Coming next

We have big plans for TimeMapper, including:

- Quickly create TimeMaps using information from Wikipedia
- Connect markers in maps to form a route
- Options for timeline- and map-only project layouts
- [Disqus](http://disqus.com)-based comments
- Core JS library, **timemapper.js**, so you can build your own apps with timemaps

Check out the [TimeMapper issues list](https://github.com/okfn/timemapper/issues) to see what ideas we’ve got and to leave suggestions.

## History and credits

TimeMapper is made possible by awesome open source libraries like [TimelineJS](http://timeline.verite.co), [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org), and [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com), not to mention open data from [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org). When we first built a TimeMapper-style site in 2007 under the title “Weaving History”, it was a real struggle over many months to build a responsive JavaScript-heavy app. Today, thanks to libraries like these and advances in browsers, it’s now a matter of weeks.
