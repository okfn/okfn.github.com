Playing with computers since he was young, Tom eventually developed back and
wrist pain, so he started studying ergonomics and conducting quantitative
ergonomics research. At some point, people started calling him a data scientist.
And his back and wrists now hurt less. He recently been
playing [music](http://csvsoundsystem.com) and
studying [open data](/open-data).
