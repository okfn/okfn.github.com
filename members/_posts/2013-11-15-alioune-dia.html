I work for NGOs and help to design softwares for health and contribute to
fight against poverty in Africa. I'm one of the leader of open source
community in Dakar and a fervent defender of free software and Open Knowledge
in general. I work with many labs tools for local projects in Senegal and in
sub-regions, and I'm a member of

University of Paris 5 and Dakar university.
