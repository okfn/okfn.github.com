Yohan is an idealist who try to actually *do* things. One of the main projects he is
working on is <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/UMap">uMap</a>, which aims to
make non technical persons use OSM data to create their embeddable web maps. He is also
an active contributor for <a href="http://hotosm.org">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a>. Before acting as idealist, he has been CTO of French newspaper <a href="http://libe.fr">Lib√©ration</a> for some long years.
