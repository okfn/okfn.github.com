  David was born at a very young age. Significantly later on, he joined
  fellow OKFNL-er <a href="/members/rossjones">Ross</a> in a quest to
  <a href="http://openhealthcare.org.uk">make the NHS less bad</a> after
  his ground-breaking research into <a href="http://www.openbnf.org/result/Woody%20nightshade">
  Digital Homeopathic Delivery Systems</a>.
