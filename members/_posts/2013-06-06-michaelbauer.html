Michael Bauer is a biomedical researcher, hacker and activist. After some
years of spending his life as a pipette-scientist he noticed he could do
something his peers couldn't: Handle data with ease. He thought: "One
needs to do somethign about this". Fast-forward over an episode of activism
for digital freedom: He joined the [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org) to do exactly this.
