Matt was involved in research of various kinds for almost 10 years: video decompression for people with visual-impairment, driving simulation for night-driving difficulties and traffic modelling. Through a joint freelance effort with my wife, Birgit Fullerton (researcher in General Practice medicine and Epidemiologist in training), I am now working on web and mobile development, sensor data capture, data analysis and visualisation. I love open data and am excited by the plethora of tools its increase has inspired.
